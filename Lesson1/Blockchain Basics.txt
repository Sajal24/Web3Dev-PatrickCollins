Blockchain was introduced for BitCoin first
But in 2014, Vitalik tookt this idea forward and with other cofounders released Ethereum in 2015 - adding the concept of decentralized organizations and decentralized agreements(smart contracts) with its Blockchain.

Originally Nick Zabo came with the idea of smart contracts in 1994.

therefore the main difference between the bitcoin protocol and the ethereum protocol is Smart contracts

basically bitcoin does have smart contracts but they are intentionally turing incomplete - meaning they don't have all the functionality that a programming language would give them
this is coz bitcoin devs saw bitcoin blockchain as a store of value while ethereum devs saw it as both store of value and a utility for facilitating the decentralized concept


The Oracle Problem:
Blockchain needs real world data inorder to work full-fledgedly but it itself can't interact with the real world 

*Blockchain Oracle - any device that interacts with the off-chain world(real world)  and provides external data and external computations to the smart contracts(blockchain).
but we can't rely on a single oracle to provide this - can't stay truly decentralized when we only have one oracle, can we?

therefore we should have decentralized oracles bringing external data and external computations to the smart contracts - making sure we are decentralized end to end
hence mixing both decentralized blockchain with decentralized oracle gives rise to the concept of Hybrid smart contracts.

Hybrid Smart Contracts = OnChain + OffChain Agreements

*dApp - decentralized applications - mainly the combination of many smart contracts
dapp = decentralized applications = decentralized protocol = smar contract



WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF SMART CONTRACTS?
They create trust minimized agreements giving rise to unbreakable promises - speed, efficiency, immutability and transparency


SMART CONTRACT
An agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
- cannot be altered(immutable)
- automatically executes
- everyone sees the terms of the agreement
