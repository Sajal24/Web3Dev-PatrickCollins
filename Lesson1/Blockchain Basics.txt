Blockchain was introduced for BitCoin first
But in 2014, Vitalik took this idea forward and with other cofounders released Ethereum in 2015 - adding the concept of decentralized organizations and decentralized agreements(smart contracts) with its Blockchain.

Originally Nick Szabo came with the idea of smart contracts in 1994.

therefore the main difference between the bitcoin protocol and the ethereum protocol is Smart contracts

basically bitcoin does have smart contracts but they are intentionally turing incomplete - meaning they don't have all the functionality that a programming language would give them
this is coz bitcoin devs saw bitcoin blockchain as a store of value while ethereum devs saw it as both store of value and a utility for facilitating the decentralized concept



The Oracle Problem:
Blockchain needs real world data inorder to work full-fledgedly but it itself can't interact with the real world 

*Blockchain Oracle - any device that interacts with the off-chain world(real world)  and provides external data and external computations to the smart contracts(blockchain).
but we can't rely on a single oracle to provide this - can't stay truly decentralized when we only have one oracle, can we?

therefore we should have decentralized oracles bringing external data and external computations to the smart contracts - making sure we are decentralized end to end
hence mixing both decentralized blockchain with decentralized oracle network gives rise to the concept of Hybrid smart contracts.

Hybrid Smart Contracts = OnChain + OffChain Agreements
(onchain code + offchain systems[triggering the onchain system, take actions on behalf of the contract, return proof that the action was taken])
[check this - https://blog.chain.link/hybrid-smart-contracts-explained/]

*dApp - decentralized applications - mainly the combination of many smart contracts
dapp = decentralized applications = decentralized protocol = smar contract



WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF SMART CONTRACTS?
They create trust minimized agreements giving rise to unbreakable promises - speed, efficiency, immutability and transparency



SMART CONTRACT
An agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
- cannot be altered(immutable)
- automatically executes
- everyone sees the terms of the agreement

Introduction to Gas
When we make transactions, the miners or validators make a small fee
the fee depends on how much of gas you use

Gas: a unit of computational measurement
the more complex your transaction is, the more gas you have to pay.
Transaction price = Gas Price x Gas usage

Depending on how busy the blockchain is, how much traffic the network has - you have to pay more gas fee
more people sending transactions at the same time means more gas costs

 

HOW DO BLOCKCHAIN WORKS
The Genesis block - first block in the blockchain

Hash: Unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data

Hash Algorithm: A algorithm/function that computes the data into a unique hash

Mining: The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
        here, problem was to find a hash that starts with four zeroes
        [problems can be different depinding on blockchain to blockchain]

        Nodes get paid for mining blocks

Block: A list of transactions mined together

Decentralized: having no single point of authority

Nonce: A "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain    problem.
       Also used to define the number of transactions for an account/address (in ethereum).

the last block's hash of each peer is compared and verified and if any of the peers had done something malicious/changed some data - then the hash of that block will change -> changing the hashes of all the block ahead of it, therefore last block's hash won't match other peers last block's hash.

that peer will be thrown out - as its whole blockchain will get invalidated - as changing data -> now we have to compute/mine a new nonce that will along with data and block number give us a new hash starting with 0000 - now same process with all the blocks following/ahead of that block - already enough computatinal power needed 


now it explains my doubt of what is a 51% attack?
basically if 51% of the peer network collectively changes the data, they'll succeed while throwing off the remaining good 49% peers. not possible though to generate enough computational power collectively as changing data and generating a new nonce so that the hash starts with 4 zeroes requires computational power.



SIGNING TRANSACTIONS
Private Key: Only known to the key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions

Public Key: Anyone can see it, and it is used to verify that a transaction came from you - is derived from private key

Signing a transaction: A "one way process" (meaning you can't obtain private key again) - a private key hashed with transaction data is used as a "message signature" - then anyone can verify this transaction hash (message signature) using our public key. 

Private key is used to generate the public key using the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm(DSA - which uses elliptic curve cryptography) - both Bitcoin and Ethereum uses this algorithm

Your address in Ethereum is derived when your public key is hashed with Keccak256 hashing algorithm and taking the last 20bits

Private key > Public Key > Address
