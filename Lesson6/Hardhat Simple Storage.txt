INTRO
Hardhat - a flexible JS based development environment to compile, deploy, test and debug EVM based smart contracts - makes things way easier!
Hardhat also comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code.



HARDHAT SETUP
yarn init (same as npm init)
yarn add --dev hardhat 
yarn hardhat (same as npx hardhat)

there are 2 types of files in node modules - one starting with '@' and others dont -> difference is that the ones starting with @ are the node modules by the offical teams.

all our compilation info is going to be stored in a folder named "artifacts".


HARDHAT SETUP TROUBLESHOOTING
1. sometimes when writing this in cli - yarn hardhat or npx hardhat -> we get a menu of options, that is good but sometimes we don't (error) coz we already have a hardhat config file somewhere else (maybe at a higher level) -> so in order to solve this, find and delete that config file. and for finding that, use -
npx hardhat --verbose
and then delete it 

2. when cloning a github repo, - for collaborating on already existing project, don't forget to npm install (or yarn) - to get all those needed node modules and dependencies in your local machine/repo 



DEPLOYING SIMPLESTORAGE FROM HARDHAT
Compile -> yarn hardhat compile
Deploy -> yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js



NETWORKS IN HARDHAT
In our hardhat config file, we by default have a - defaultNetwork: "hardhat" -> our local ethereum blockchain running in the background, akin to Ganache - comes with the RPC and PK, so don't have to add any.

so we can add different networks here and then deploy our smart contract on diff networks.
in terminal - yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
and goerli should be specified as a network in your config file

so specify - goerli : {
    url: GOERLI_RPC_URL,
    accounts: [],
    chainId: ,
}
account - list of accounts, for adding private key.
that's it, deploy now -> yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli



PROGRAMATIC VERIFICATION
remember how when we check this deployed contract's address, there is the option of contract where our contract lies in its binary code format, and then we verify and publish and do all that stuff.
Let's see how we can do it in the code itself - to automatically verify right after we deploy.

we are learning to verify on etherscan, (can check for documentation>api for other block explorers, let's see for this one here), go to Etherscan>APIdocs
[https://docs.etherscan.io/v/goerli-etherscan/api-endpoints/contracts#verify-source-code]

we will add a plugin here - #hardhat-etherscan (you'll get it on hardhat documentation), so
    yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
    require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan") [in hardhat config file]

Now we need a etherscan API key - get it from etherscan, add that to your env file and then hardhat config file and then create the verify function, call that at the end of the main function, but also add the error possibility that the contract we are trying to verify could already be verifed, and when calling this verify() in main(), see that it won't work out with local hardhat network -> for that, import network and check with chainId, so yeah that's pretty much it!

    if (network.config.chainId === 5 && process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY) {
        await simpleStorage.deployTransaction.wait(6)
        await verify(simpleStorage.address, [])
        }
    }

    async function verify(contractAddress, args) {
        console.log("verifying contract ...")
        try {
         await run("verify: verify", {
                address: contractAddress,
                constructorArguements: args,
            })
        } catch (e) {
          if (e.message.toLowerCase().includes("already verified")) {
                console.log("already verified!")
            } else {
                console.log(e)
            }
        }
    }

INTERACTING WITH CONTRACTS IN HARDHAT
same as before



ARTIFACTS TROUBLESHOOTING
just delete the artifacts folder and run our deploy cmd (it will compile the code and generate the artifacts folder itself at first)
