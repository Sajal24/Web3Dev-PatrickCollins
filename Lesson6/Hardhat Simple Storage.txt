INTRO
Hardhat - a flexible JS based development environment to compile, deploy, test and debug EVM based smart contracts - makes things way easier!
Hardhat also comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code.



HARDHAT SETUP
yarn init (same as npm init)
yarn add --dev hardhat 
yarn hardhat (same as npx hardhat)

there are 2 types of files in node modules - one starting with '@' and others dont -> difference is that the ones starting with @ are the node modules by the offical teams.

all our compilation info is going to be stored in a folder named "artifacts".


HARDHAT SETUP TROUBLESHOOTING
1. sometimes when writing this in cli - yarn hardhat or npx hardhat -> we get a menu of options, that is good but sometimes we don't (error) coz we already have a hardhat config file somewhere else (maybe at a higher level) -> so in order to solve this, find and delete that config file. and for finding that, use -
npx hardhat --verbose
and then delete it 

2. when cloning a github repo, - for collaborating on already exisitng project, don't forget to npm install (or yarn) - to get all those needed node modules and dependencies in your local machine/repo
