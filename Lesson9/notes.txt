Its going to be superrrr fun!!!
It is the flagship project, if you learn this, then you have the skills to learn all the rest of the smart contract concepts 

HARDHAT SETUP
    yarn init
    yarn add --dev hardhat
    yarn hardhat > select a empty hardhat file, then copy the dependancies from source code(you can see what dependancies we installed in package.json file)

    then copy paste dependancies from the fcc github:

    yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle hardhat hardhat-contract-sizer hardhat-deploy hardhat-gas-reporter prettier prettier-plugin-solidity solhint solidity-coverage dotenv



RAFFLE.SOL SETUP



Now always comment and write in the start of your contract that what are you building - break them down into small goals/fncs

also, instead of require statements and storing that big string as our revert message, we can use custom errors.
