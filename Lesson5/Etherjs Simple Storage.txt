DEBUGGING
This is going to be the piece that is going to give you the superpower to unblock yourself from any coding issue I run into!

Tinker and figure out yourself - keep hitting and trying
Limit tinkering to 20 minutes -> take at least 15 min yourself -> exhaust yourself completely trying all the options

1. Tinker and try to pinpoint exactly what's going on
2. Google the exact error - be patient, explore all answers patiently
3. Ask a question on a forum like Stack Exchange ETH and Stack Overflow

Five steps from the original yt video of Patrick about Debugging:

1. Tinker and Experiment - Pinpoint exactly what's going wrong here
2. Check the docs
3. Google!
4. Ask questions on Forums
5. Join & Strengthen the community and tool



INSTALLATION & SETUP
Hardhat - a smart contract developer framework similar to brownie or foundry.
then why Hardhat? - coz it's JS based development environment

first we will learn Ethers.js - a js based library for working with smart contracts

gitpod - a cloud development environment - run your code on a remote server, similar to remix IDE but allows you to run VS Code in the browser or connected to another server.



COMPILING OUR SOLIDITY CODE
we need to install a solidity compiles - npm install solc
or yarn add solc

then add a script: {
    "compile": "yarn solcjs --bin --abi --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . -o . SimpleStorage.sol"
}

used to compile your code/
