DEBUGGING
This is going to be the piece that is going to give you the superpower to unblock yourself from any coding issue I run into!

Tinker and figure out yourself - keep hitting and trying
Limit tinkering to 20 minutes -> take at least 15 min yourself -> exhaust yourself completely trying all the options

1. Tinker and try to pinpoint exactly what's going on
2. Google the exact error - be patient, explore all answers patiently
3. Ask a question on a forum like Stack Exchange ETH and Stack Overflow

Five steps from the original yt video of Patrick about Debugging:

1. Tinker and Experiment - Pinpoint exactly what's going wrong here
2. Check the docs
3. Google!
